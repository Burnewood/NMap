# Neighborhood  Map project

## Description
This final project of the FEND Udacity course serves the purpose of demonstrating api use within a react-based JavaScript application. The purpose of the project is to create a responsive one page application displaying points of interest in an area map, with information on those locations and other functionality presented in another view.

## How to run
Node.js is required on your system to start a server, once it is installed:

Download a copy of this repository (via clone or zip)

Navigate to the directory where you have stored the application then run the following code
For development build of the project
```
npm install

npm start
```
For Production build of the project
```
npm install

npm run build

/* may require installing noted npm serve */

serve -s  build
```
This should automatically open a new browser window displaying the application. If the window is closed or does not initially open, go to http://localhost:3000/ (or the noted address) in your browser.
Please note: Offline use & serviceworker portions of this project will only work within the production build of the project
